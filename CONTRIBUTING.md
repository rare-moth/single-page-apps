## How to contribute

Each folder in rare-moth/single-page-apps repository is stand alone project.

You can either contribute to existing projects or submit your own.

## Requirements
1. Each project must be a self contained, single page application - **SPA**. Example technologies you can use:
AngularJS, Elm, Ember.js, Gatsby, Meteor.js, Next.js, React, Vue.js, etc.

Project ideas: todo list, memory card game, photo gallery, calculator, clock, form validator

2. A project must have a **README.md** file outlining:
- what the application does 
- what technology was used
- setting up instructions

*Happy coding, and long live open source* 👩‍💻 :unicorn:
