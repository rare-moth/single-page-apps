## How to contribute

Each folder in rare-moth/single-page-apps repository is stand alone project.

You can either contribute to existing projects or submit your own. There can be more than one solution to an issue and it is wonderful to see different approaches.

## Requirements
1. Each project must be a self contained, single page application - **SPA**. Example technologies you can use:
AngularJS, Elm, Ember.js, Gatsby, Meteor.js, Next.js, React, Vue.js, etc.

Project ideas: todo list, memory card game, photo gallery, calculator, clock, form validator

2. A project must have a **README.md** file outlining:
- description of App (what is it for?)
- brief outline of stack (tech used)
- setting up instructions (npm install, etc.)
